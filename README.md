## Introduction
English | [简体中文](README_zh-CN.md)

DL-Traff is an open resourse project which offers a benchmark for traffic prediction on grid-based and graph-based models. DL-Traff-Graph is a part of graph-based project. This main branch works on Pytorch1.6. Different versions of Pytorch vary slightly in training time and performance. In this github, we integrate two traditional statistical methods(HistoricalAverage and CopyLastFrame), one time series models (LSTNet) and a large number of graph models into one platform. We maintain that all models are based on the same data processing, the same hyperparameters, and the same computing environment such as the version of Pytorch and Cudnn. Although this makes the models fail to achieve the final convergence effection, the performance of different network architectures under the same conditions will be fully reflected by our experiment. We will update the optimization results of each model in later work.

## Installation Dependencies
Working environment and major dependencies:
* Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS
* Python 3 (>= 3.6; Anaconda Distribution)
* PyTorch (>= 1.6.0)  py3.6_cuda10.1.243_cudnn7.6.3_0

### User guide
Download this project into your device, the code project will be downloaded into the current path where you type this powershell command:
```
git clone git@github.com:deepkashiwa20/DL-Traff-Graph.git
```

Use the STGCN model on METRLA dataset as an example to demonstrate how to use it. 
* dataset 
<br>**NOTE!** <br> remember to unzip pems-bay.zip to pems-bay.h5 before you run the programe on PEMSBAY dataset, we only upload compressed data due to file size limitation.
```
cd /PEMSBAY
unzip pems-bay.h5
```

* debug and run model
```
cd /workMETRLA

# Debug the model on video card 1 :
python STGCN.py 1

# Run the main program to train, prediction and test on video card 1:
python pred_STGCN3.py 1

# View the result after the operation is complete.
cd /save/pred_STGCN_METRLA_21061600
