There are mainly two ways for data spliting when build samples.

In one method, we split the dataset into trainset,valset and testset by some ratio(e.g., trainset : valset : testset=7:1:2), 
then get features and build samples respectively.

For example, assume that the dataset's shape is (10000, 1), sample's shape is (12, 1) for each x and (6, 1) for each Y.
Then we get data with (7000, 1) for training, (1000, 1) for validation, (2001, 1) for testing.
So we get 7000-12-6+1 = 6983 samples for training, 983 samples for validation, 1983 samples for testing.

In the other method, we get features and build samples from the complete dataset, then we split them into different sets by ratio.
Let's use the same dataset above with shape (10000, 1), (12, 1) for each x and (6, 1) for each y.
Then we get 10000-12-6+1 = 9983 samples.
9983*0.7 = 6988.1 9983*0.8 = 7986.4
Thus we get 6988 samples for training, 7986-6988 = 998 samples for validation, 9983-7986 = 1997 samples for testing.

In DLTraff, we use the first method in pred_[ModelName] files.
We use the second method in dataprepare_ files.
